The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other kinds of works.

You can change the software and use pieces of it in new free programs.  
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you can allocate your changes to the public.  

By protecting everyones' freedom, we ensure that the software is free for all its users.  

This General Public License applies to all of the software that is licensed by the Free Software Foundation.
